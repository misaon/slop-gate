# M0 follow-ups and known limitations

**Date:** 2026-07-31
**Status:** Backlog, carried out of the M0 branch review

Everything here was found during M0, judged real, and deliberately not fixed in M0. Each entry says
why it was deferred so a later milestone does not have to re-derive the reasoning.

## Blocks M2 — read before adding any type-aware rule

**oxlint reports `number_of_rules: 0` for its 59 type-aware rules unless `--type-aware` is passed**,
which `packages/engine-oxlint/src/index.ts` does not pass, and which additionally needs the separate
`oxlint-tsgolint` package that `engine-oxlint` does not depend on.

The moment a registry entry elects a type-aware rule, `parse.ts`'s rule-count assertion throws
`EngineError: the materialised config is not selecting exactly the elected ruleset` on every run.
That message is actively misleading — the real cause is a missing capability, not a config defect.

Dormant today: the only non-`eslint`-scope oxlint rule in the registry is `typescript/no-explicit-any`,
which is `type_aware: false`.

M2's type-aware work must land the flag, the dependency, and a capability probe in one change. The
socket for that probe already exists and is now wired: `check.ts` derives `capabilities` from each
engine's declared `provides`, so an engine announcing `provides: ['types']` will let arbitration
elect rules declaring `requires: ['types']`.

---

## Restructure before M2, not after

**`streamCheck` (`packages/core/src/run/check.ts`) owns too much for a multi-engine scheduler.** One
generator currently derives cache keys, looks up the cache, batches, invokes engines, normalizes,
writes the cache, orders and aggregates.

M2 needs project-granularity engines started first, per-engine batch sizes, worker-pool affinity and
streaming across engines — all scheduling decisions that must be made *from the plan*. The plan
cannot make them today because the cache check happens inside the run loop, and it genuinely cannot
move into `buildPlan` as written: the cache key needs `engineVersion` and `handle.rulesetHash`, which
only the engine can supply.

The shape M2 needs is a distinct **prepare** phase (resolve version and ruleset hash per engine),
then a cache-aware **plan**, then **scheduling**. Doing that split with one engine and 294 tests to
lean on is far cheaper than doing it with twelve.

Related: the planner is not cache-aware, so a fully-cached run still calls `version()` (a real
subprocess spawn) and `materializeConfig()` (a temp-file write and delete) for an engine with nothing
to do — and a missing engine binary fails the run with exit 3 even when every result is cached.
Spec §8.1 assigns the cache filter to the planner; M0 does not implement that.

## Should fix soon

- **No per-engine timeout.** `execFile` sets `maxBuffer` but not `timeout`, so a hung engine hangs
  `sgate` indefinitely. Spec §18 requires one.
- **A missing engine binary yields `spawn … ENOENT`** with no install command, against §18's
  "actionable message containing the exact install command".
- **`fingerprint()` rebuilds the line index per diagnostic.** `packages/core/src/diagnostics/fingerprint.ts`
  calls `createLineIndex` on the whole file while its caller in `normalize.ts` already has one cached
  per file. The Task 2 deferral said "revisit when normalization batches per file"; it now does.
- **`readJson` swallows every error** in `packages/core/src/discovery/workspaces.ts`, so a malformed
  root `package.json` silently yields no workspaces. This is the last instance of the class that was
  deliberately fixed for `pnpm-workspace.yaml` fifteen lines below it.
- **`git ls-files --deduplicate` needs git ≥ 2.31** (2021) with no fallback. `selectFileSource`
  catches only `rev-parse` failure, so if `ls-files` rejects the flag the whole run dies with a raw
  git error. Ubuntu 20.04 ships git 2.25.
- **`MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON`.** Running in a project without `"type": "module"` prints four
  lines of Node warning on every run, because `loadConfig` dynamically imports a `.ts` file. It goes
  to stderr, so `--format json` piping is unaffected — but it is the first thing a new user sees.
  Both honest fixes (emit `.mts`, or have `init` set `"type": "module"` in someone else's
  `package.json`) belong to a task that owns config authoring. Schedule before any public release.
- **`.slopignore` accepts globs, not gitignore patterns.** `vendor`, `vendor/`, `/vendor` and `*.ts`
  exclude nothing; only `vendor/**` works. M0 corrected the docstring and spec §7 to state the actual
  behaviour and pinned it with tests. Implementing real gitignore semantics — negation, directory
  versus file disambiguation — is a spec-worthy problem, not a final-wave call.

## Test gaps worth closing

- **No non-ASCII or CRLF end-to-end fixture.** Spec §10 says multi-byte content "is covered by
  explicit fixtures" and §17 requires them from M0. Unit coverage in `position.test.ts` is good; the
  engine→reporter chain has none. Verified by hand during review: oxlint byte offset 56 maps to
  UTF-16 column 50 on a line containing 2-, 3- and 4-byte characters.
- **No test exercises a successful pass through `importTransformed`** (the config loader's
  `oxc-transform` fallback). Proven correct by hand with a TS `enum` config; no regression guard.
- **No test for the `engine-failed` stream event**, only the aggregated `engineFailures`.
- **CI never runs `sgate check` on this repository**, so a regression in the shipped registry or
  presets would not be caught. Cheap dogfooding now that the answer is a clean zero.

## Decide rather than defer again

- **`Diagnostic.engine` is a bare `string`, so `'slop-gate'` type-checks but is not an `EngineId`.**
  A user cannot silence a config diagnostic as `'slop-gate/config.dead-override': 'off'` — that
  spelling emits a *new* dead-override about itself. The documented canonical form,
  `'config.dead-override': 'off'`, works. Widening `EngineId` touches `ENGINE_PREFERENCE`,
  `RuleEntry.engine` and the arbitration ranking, so it wants to be a deliberate change.
- **`RawDiagnostic.severity` is required and no consumer reads it.** Either read it as a fallback
  when no config level applies, or delete it — before eleven more adapters dutifully populate it.
- **A complete `workspace-config` provenance layer exists with no producer.** Nothing discovers a
  per-workspace `slop-gate.config.ts`, so spec §6.1/§6.2's per-workspace config is silently ignored
  when running from the root, and `InventoryFile.workspace` is computed for every file and read only
  by a test. Same for `SlopGateConfig.workspaces` and `engines`, both of which type-check and do
  nothing — and `engines: { eslint: { enabled: 'auto' } }` appears in the spec's own example config.
  Either an M1 line item or a documented limitation; right now it is neither.
- **oxlint's `--rules` output spells two scopes with underscores** (`jsx_a11y`, `react_perf`) while
  the diagnostic `code` field hyphenates them. A future registry entry for those scopes must use the
  hyphenated form, which is what the parser accepts.

## Accepted as is

The registry's own oxlint/eslint tier overlap emits a `config.rule-overlap` info diagnostic about
slop-gate's internals on every run. That diagnostic is an M0 acceptance requirement — it proves
arbitration is visible — so it stays. `uncovered` no longer reports slop-gate's synthetic concepts.

`positionAt` yields U+FFFD for an offset inside a multi-byte character; oxlint's offsets are always on
character boundaries, verified. `findConfigFile` walks past the repository boundary, matching
prettier and tsconfig convention. The tautological invariant tests in `entries.test.ts` and
`presets.test.ts` are kept: the types already enforce them, and deleting them removes documentation
of intent for no gain.

## One thing M0 does not demonstrate

`sgate check` on this repository reports **zero** error- or warning-level findings against its own
code. That is a good result, but it means M0's "reports real findings" acceptance bullet is
demonstrated only by the committed e2e fixture, never by self-checking. Worth knowing when judging
whether the gate has teeth.
